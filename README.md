Linear Regression model to predict California housing prices

This project uses the **California Housing Dataset** from `scikit-learn` to predict median house prices using **Linear Regression**.

##  Steps in the project:
1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess features (scaling)
3. Train a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate the model (MSE, R²)
5. Predict new house prices
6. Visualize Actual vs Predicted results

##  Example Results
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~0.53  
- **R² Score:** ~0.61  

##  Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
